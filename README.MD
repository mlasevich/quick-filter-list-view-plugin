This plugin offers a wrapped version of standard ListView that adds ability to
filter the displayed jobs in the view based on text

# About this plugin

The Quick Filter List View plugin extends list view to allow user to quickly
filter the job list to find the job(s) they are interested in. Because this is
an extension of standard ListView - all of its features/columns are supported.


***NOTE***: This plugin is experimental at this time.
